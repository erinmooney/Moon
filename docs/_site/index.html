    <p>Here is the link to <a href="resume.html">my resume</a>!</p>
    
    <p>Welcome to My World! Here is some information about me:</p>
    
    <p><i>"Hello! I'm Erin Mooney, and I am an artist. Specifically, a multimedia artist which is a fancy way of saying I like to do everything. My favorite things to make art of are characters and world-building."</i></p>                    
    
    <p><i>"One of the coolest things that an artist can do is transport the viewer to a place from the artist's imagination (or whatever subject they wanted to portray)."</i></p>

    <h3><strong>About my art</strong></h3>
    <p>As you can probably tell with my little mascot, Birdard (above), I love making characters and world-building. </p>
    <p>I love creating characters and worlds. I am very imaginative and I let that imagination run wild! I think that one of the most powerful attributes an artist has, is the power to make drawings come to life. Therefore, I use that power as much as I can.</p>

    <h3>List of Favored Mediums (in no particular order):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Traditional</li>
        <li>Digital</li>
        <li>Photography</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This doesn't necessarily mean I cannot use or refuse to use others. I just really enjoy using these the most! 
        I love drawing and painting traditionally, and also digitally. I have a lot of experience drawing in Photoshop, Illustrator, and ProCreate. </p>
