    <p>Hello! I'm Erin Mooney, and I am an artist. Specifically, a multimedia artist which is a fancy way of saying I like to do everything. My favorite things to make art of are characters and world-building.</p>
    
    <p>As you can probably tell with my little mascot, Birdard (above), I love making characters and world-building. </p>
    
    <p>I love creating characters and worlds. I am very imaginative and I let that imagination run wild! I think that one of the most powerful attributes an artist has, is the power to make drawings come to life. Therefore, I use that power as much as I can.</p>
